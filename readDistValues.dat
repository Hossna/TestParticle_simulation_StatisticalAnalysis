mass:  the mass of the particles

q:  the charge of the particles

type_integration: the value of type_integration used by the program 
		  densityOct to calculate the distribution functions.

numFiles: the number of files containing distribution functions.

xstart: the xposition corresponding to the first distribution function 
	(distfunct000001.out).

step: the amount by which the x position changes from one distribution 
      function to the next.
